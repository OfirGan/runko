// that need more precision are temporarily casted to double (and 
// back to float_m in the end). I.e., most of the algorithms are mixed-precision.
// It is also worth mentioning that most IO files are already manually set 
// to float type to reduce storage requirements.

// Separate short float type for particles. In most applications it is enough
// to keep this as float. However, some special cases might require extra
// resolution (e.g. with large Lorentz factors) so fall-back to double might 
// be needed.
//
// NOTE: Some calculations are still mixed-precision, as before, because critical
// numerical parts are still done via double precision.
